## The DSE datasets to store the results by different algorithms

- sa_ds: simulated annealing (SA)
- nsga_ds: multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)
- motpe_d_ds: MOTPE with discrete encoding (MOTPE-D)
- motpe_f_ds: MOTPE with float encoding (MOTPE-F)
- motpe_fl_ds: Latin hypercube sampling based MOTPE with float encoding (MOTPE-FL)
- impl_ds: MOTPE-FL with FPGA implementation flow to evaluate PPA

To collect the dataset for HGP training, dataset generator is run and the samples are stored in random_ds.
